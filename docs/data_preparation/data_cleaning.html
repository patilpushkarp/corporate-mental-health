<h1>Data Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>OSMI has all the links of the data on their <a class="reference external" href="https://osmihelp.org">website</a> under the <a class="reference external" href="https://osmihelp.org/research">research</a> section for all the years starting from year 2014. The organization has hosted their datasets on kaggle. I took the data from the year 2017 onwards because the question asked haven’t changed from 2017 and hence it will be easier to combine the data.</p>
<p>All the datasets are downloaded in csv format and renamed to with respect to corresponding years in the format “osmi_&lt;year&gt;.csv”. Here &lt;year&gt; is the placeholder for the year. For example, data for year 2017 is present in file named “osmi_2017.csv”</p>
