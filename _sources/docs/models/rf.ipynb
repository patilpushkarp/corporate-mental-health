It won't harm any of us to visit a mental health professional even if we need not seek any help for any mental health issue. On the other hand the model is quite good at telling in case we that much needed help from mental health professional. An average F1 score of 0.85 is quite good considering the amount of data that we are training with. Though the model is quite better in predicting the individuals who need help than the ones who do not, the values of specificity and sensitivity are not far apart and hence the overall performance of the model is laudable."
